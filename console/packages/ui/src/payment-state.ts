/**
 * The shielded-payment lifecycle as a pure state machine, shared by both apps so
 * "what's happening to my money right now" is modeled once. A private payment is
 * not one network call, it is build-witness → prove (seconds, on-device) →
 * submit → confirm, and the UI must show each phase honestly (especially the
 * proving wait, which is the unfamiliar part for a Cash-App-shaped user).
 *
 * Pure reducer + selectors; the React hook in `hooks.ts` is a thin wrapper.
