/**
 * The 3-phase send ceremony, modeled as a pure projection of the payment state
 * machine (payment-state.ts). The animation is a SLAVE to the machine, never a
 * timer: phase 1 ("encrypt") holds through building+proving, phase 2 ("settle")
 * through submitting, phase 3 ("verify") on confirmed. This is the line between a
 * credible ZK demo and a progress-bar lie, so the mapping lives here, tested,
 * and both apps render it (warm coin-ceremony in the wallet, condensed strip in
 * the console).
 *
 * Pure + framework-agnostic: no React, no framer. The presentational components
 * import this to know WHAT to show; HOW is per-app.
