/**
 * Sponsored reserves (CAP-33), gasless onboarding.
 *
 * A new Stellar account normally needs ~1 XLM of base reserve before it can
 * exist or hold a USDC trustline. That is the single biggest friction for a
 * web2 user who has never heard of XLM. With sponsored reserves, Benzo's
 * sponsor account pays the reserve while the user's account starts at a 0 XLM
 * balance, the user funds nothing and signs once.
 *
 * The on-chain shape is a three-operation sandwich:
 *   beginSponsoringFutureReserves(sponsoredId = newAccount)   [signed by sponsor]
 *   createAccount(destination = newAccount, startingBalance 0) [signed by sponsor]
 *   endSponsoringFutureReserves()                              [signed by newAccount]
 *
 * Both the sponsor and the new account must sign the resulting transaction
 * (the new account authorizes the end of its own sponsorship). The same pattern
 * extends to sponsoring the USDC trustline and the shielded-note data entries.
