/**
 * Central copy constants, reusable privacy / disclosure wording so every screen
 * says the same thing the same way. Business language first; cryptographic detail
 * only where it earns its place. Screens adopt these in later waves; exported now so
 * the vocabulary is fixed before the rewrites start.
 *
 * Rule of thumb:
 *  - PRIVACY.privateOnChain, the amount AND recipient are not publicly visible.
 *  - PRIVACY.visibleToWorkspace, authorized teammates can see it in this console.
 *  - PRIVACY.hiddenDueToRole, you personally can't see it (your role, not a failure).
 *  - PRIVACY.disclosedThroughProof, revealed deliberately, backed by an on-chain proof.
 *  - PRIVACY.hideBalances, the screen-level mask toggle label.
