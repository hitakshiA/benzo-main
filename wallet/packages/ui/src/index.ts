/**
 * @benzo/ui, shared, framework-agnostic privacy/payment primitives for both
 * Benzo apps (pay.benzo.xyz consumer + work.benzo.xyz console).
 *
 * The *logic* lives here (formatting, the payment/proving/wallet state machines,
 * balance masking) so both apps behave identically; the *presentational* chrome
 * (cards, buttons, Tailwind tokens) stays per-app. React hooks in `./hooks`
 * connect the pure reducers to a screen, import those only in a React app.
