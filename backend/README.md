  <strong>Private USDC-style payments on Avalanche.</strong><br />
  Shield a public ERC-20 into an encrypted eERC balance, send it privately,
  and keep a rotatable auditor key for controlled review.
</p>

## What Benzo Does

Benzo is a private payments system for stablecoin workflows. Users register an
eERC key, deposit a public ERC-20 into the converter, and then send encrypted
balances on-chain. Groth16 proofs enforce balance correctness while transfer
amounts and balances stay encrypted. A designated auditor public key receives a
separate decryptable ciphertext for compliance review.

Privacy in this README means privacy enforced by on-chain proofs and
encryption. Benzo does not claim to hide addresses, timestamps, gas payments,
or product workflow metadata unless a section says so explicitly.

## Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["Wallet / Console<br/>eerc-sdk · in-browser proofs"] -->|Groth16 proof| B["EncryptedERC converter<br/>Registrar · 5 verifiers"]
  A -->|SIWE session| C["services/api<br/>orgs · payroll · activity"]
  B -. auditor ciphertext .-> D["Rotatable auditor key"]
  B --> E["Avalanche<br/>C-Chain mainnet · Fuji · BenzoNet L1"]
```

The wallet and console use `@avalabs/eerc-sdk` with wagmi/viem, snarkjs, and
served circuit files (`.wasm` and `.zkey`) to produce proofs in the browser.
Those proofs settle against the `Registrar`, `EncryptedERC`, and five Groth16
verifier contracts. Every private operation also carries an auditor ciphertext
encrypted to the current auditor public key. The `services/api` layer holds
session, org, and workflow state; it never sees decrypted balances.

BenzoNet is the permissioned deployment path: an Evergreen-style institutional
L1 with PoA validator control, `txAllowList` as the KYC gate, a valueless gas
token (`BGAS`), and `validatorOnly` read privacy. Benzo deliberately stops
there; no extra institutional machinery is added just to chase the label.

## The Six Flows

### 1. Private Payroll

A company funds a treasury, registers employees, and sends payroll through
eERC private transfers. The proof system protects payroll amounts on-chain;
the payroll schedule, roster, and approval state are workflow data that belong
in the console/API layer.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  C["Console / API<br/>roster · schedule"] -. orchestrates .-> T["Company treasury"]
  T -->|eERC private transfer| E1["Employee"]
  T -->|eERC private transfer| E2["Employee"]
```

### 2. Shielded Stablecoin Transfers

A user deposits a public test ERC-20 such as `tUSDC`, receives an encrypted
balance, and sends privately to another registered user. The receiver decrypts
locally and can later withdraw back to a public ERC-20 balance.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  P["Public tUSDC"] -->|deposit / wrap| B["Your encrypted balance"]
  B -->|private transfer| B2["Recipient balance"]
  B2 -->|withdraw| P2["Public tUSDC"]
```

### 3. Auditor-Ready Treasury

An organization can operate with encrypted treasury balances while still
keeping an auditor path. The on-chain contract is configured with a current
auditor public key; the demo key is operator-controlled in this repo, not an
independent custodian.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Tx["Private eERC transfer"] -->|ciphertext to owner| O["Owner reads balance"]
  Tx -->|ciphertext to auditor key| A["Auditor decrypts for review"]
```

### 4. KYC-Gated Chain (Stretch)

BenzoNet is the permissioned-chain path for institutions that need both eERC
amount privacy and chain access control. The current service includes mock KYC
workflow state; a real provider integration is outside this repo state.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  U["User address"] --> G{"txAllowList gate<br/>precompile"}
  G -->|allowed| L["BenzoNet L1<br/>eERC + BGAS"]
  G -->|not allowed| X["rejected"]
```

### 5. Confidential B2B Settlement

Invoices can be represented by opaque commitments while the settlement itself
uses an eERC private transfer. The commitment registry is bookkeeping: it does
not prove that a specific transfer paid a specific invoice.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  I["InvoiceRegistry<br/>opaque commitment"] -. bookkeeping .-> P["Payer"]
  P -->|eERC private transfer| Q["Payee"]
```

### 6. Private Gifting

Gift links have two tiers. The public escrow contract is simple and visible on
chain. The private bearer-link path uses an ephemeral registered address and an
eERC private transfer, so the amount is encrypted but the link is a bearer
secret.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  S["Sender"] -->|public path| G["GiftEscrow<br/>amount visible"]
  S -->|private path| E["Ephemeral address<br/>+ eERC transfer"]
  E --> B["Bearer-link claim<br/>amount encrypted"]
```

## What Is Real vs. Simulated

| Area | Real today | Boundary to keep honest |
| --- | --- | --- |
| eERC stack | `EncryptedERC`, `Registrar`, five Groth16 verifiers, and `BabyJubJub` are deployed on **Avalanche C-Chain mainnet (`43114`)**, Fuji (`43113`), and the BenzoNet L1 (`68420`). | Mainnet is a **fresh deploy**: unaudited, and the `Ownable` admin is still the hot deploy key (not yet moved to a multisig / cold wallet). All ten mainnet contracts are source-verified on Snowtrace, see the mainnet table below. |
| BenzoNet L1 (the bonus combo) | The same eERC stack is deployed on the BenzoNet L1 (`68420`). A **real confidential eERC transfer runs on it** (deposit + private transfer, decrypt-verified) and the **tx-allowlist precompile gates every transaction**, a funded non-member is rejected on-chain. So encrypted amounts move *inside* a gated chain. Public RPC `rpc.benzo.space`, explorer [explorer.benzo.space](https://explorer.benzo.space). See [Live proof on BenzoNet](#deployed-on-benzonet-l1--the-bonus-combo-proven). | `validatorOnly` read-restriction is intentionally left OFF so the demo stays publicly verifiable; a production institutional deployment enables it. BenzoNet is a single-validator PoA chain. |
| Stablecoin asset | Mainnet wraps **real Circle USDC** (`tokenId 1`) and EURC (`tokenId 2`); Fuji wraps Circle **testnet** USDC + EURC; BenzoNet wraps a faucet `tUSDC`. | The mainnet converter holds real value, treat it as an unaudited, fresh deployment, not a hardened production system. |
| Privacy | Groth16 verifiers and BabyJubJub encryption enforce encrypted balances and transfer amounts on-chain. | Addresses, timing, token approvals, gas funding, and workflow labels are still public or off-chain metadata. |
| Proving setup | The five verifiers backing mainnet come from a **completed Groth16 phase-2 ceremony** (three sequential contributions on separate ephemeral machines, sealed with a public drand beacon); see [`docs/ceremony/transcript.md`](docs/ceremony/transcript.md). | It was a single-coordinator, 3-machine run, **not** an open multi-party ceremony with external participants; its soundness rests on the published, re-verifiable transcript plus the unbiasable beacon. Generated `.wasm`/`.zkey` artifacts stay uncommitted. |
| Auditor | An auditor public key is set on-chain on mainnet, Fuji, and BenzoNet, so private operations are enabled (they fail closed until it is set). | The auditor is an operator-controlled key, not an independent audit firm or custody system. |
| Wallet and console | The mobile-first wallet and desktop-first console are ported to the Avalanche/eERC stack and live in their own repos: [`Miny-Labs/benzo-wallet`](https://github.com/Miny-Labs/benzo-wallet) and [`Miny-Labs/benzo-console`](https://github.com/Miny-Labs/benzo-console). | This repository is backend + infrastructure only; it has no `apps/` workspace. |
| API service | `services/api` has Fastify, Postgres, SIWE sessions, onboarding, activity indexing, orgs, contacts, handles, and invite metadata. | KYC is mock-only. Workflow data is not payment privacy. |
| Payroll | Org treasury custody and roles are modeled in the API. | Server-side payroll proving and production custody controls are follow-up work. |
| B2B invoices | `InvoiceRegistry` stores commitment-only invoices and payee attestations. | It does not verify payment amount, token, or that an eERC transfer belongs to an invoice. |
| Gift links | `GiftEscrow` is tested for public-token gifts; the private bearer-link path is exercised by script. | Public escrow reveals amount/sender/timing. Private bearer links have no on-chain expiry or refund enforcement. |

## Deployed on Avalanche Mainnet, live

The full eERC converter stack plus the gift-escrow and CCTP peripherals are
**deployed on Avalanche C-Chain mainnet (`43114`)** and wrap **real Circle USDC**
(`tokenId 1`) and EURC (`tokenId 2`). The auditor public key is set on-chain.
Source of truth: [`contracts/deployments/avalanche.json`](contracts/deployments/avalanche.json)
and [`packages/config/src/deployments/avalanche.json`](packages/config/src/deployments/avalanche.json).
A per-network breakdown for all three chains lives in [`docs/DEPLOYMENTS.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENTS.md).

This is a **fresh deployment**: it is unaudited and the `Ownable` admin is still
the hot deploy key (`0x09b6…9846`), not yet transferred to a multisig / cold
wallet. The "Verified" column reflects the deployment manifest, all ten mainnet
contracts are source-verified on Snowtrace.

(`tokenId 2`). Auditor account `0x5ba6F05b245C06c3a4C05e7bC4486dE3661393ea`; its
BabyJubJub private half is a local operator secret and is never committed.

**CCTP onramp, proven end-to-end.** A single **0.1 USDC** burn on Base was
Circle-attested and settled on Avalanche by the relayer (settle tx
[`0xc479b7c8d7a62fde5189d5c03b7f7fe8b5b4ad44afd42eea1aaf194c7556f8a3`](https://snowtrace.io/tx/0xc479b7c8d7a62fde5189d5c03b7f7fe8b5b4ad44afd42eea1aaf194c7556f8a3)),
then credited into an encrypted eERC balance. `BenzoCCTPRouter` allow-lists USDC
and EURC with source maps for Ethereum / Base / Arbitrum / Optimism USDC and
Ethereum / Base EURC. The onramp poller runs as a second backend container. This
is proven by **one** test burn, it is not load-tested or adversarially hardened.

## Deployed on Fuji

The eERC converter stack is deployed on Avalanche Fuji C-Chain (`43113`) and
wraps Circle **testnet** USDC + EURC. Full deployment metadata lives in
[`contracts/deployments/fuji.json`](contracts/deployments/fuji.json). This
testnet path is where the 17/17 real-funds flows run.

The Fuji auditor account recorded in the deployment manifest is
`0x13b8d12414dd468a9eCbA24d0a162C17affd6D32`. Its BabyJubJub private key is a
local operator secret and must never be committed.

## Deployed on BenzoNet L1, the bonus combo, proven

BenzoNet is Benzo's own permissioned Avalanche L1 (Subnet-EVM, chain id `68420`,
gas token BGAS). The **same eERC converter stack** is deployed on it, so encrypted
eERC amounts move **inside** a gated chain, the Speedrun's explicit bonus
(encrypted amounts *and* gated access at once). It is a **testnet** L1 (single
validator, funded ~3 weeks); no mainnet BenzoNet is deployed. Public RPC:
`https://rpc.benzo.space` · explorer: [explorer.benzo.space](https://explorer.benzo.space)
· full manifest: [`contracts/deployments/benzonet.json`](contracts/deployments/benzonet.json).

| Contract | Address (BenzoNet `68420`) |
| --- | --- |
| `EncryptedERC` converter | [`0xEE46418e5EeFE6f74EFaa9beb370B59251BFFb02`](https://explorer.benzo.space/address/0xEE46418e5EeFE6f74EFaa9beb370B59251BFFb02) |
| `Registrar` | [`0x0B1f4e78C54E7696663b62F9cD7956f5FDE5b71d`](https://explorer.benzo.space/address/0x0B1f4e78C54E7696663b62F9cD7956f5FDE5b71d) |
| `TestUSDC` (`tUSDC`, `tokenId 1`) | [`0x25B6a6bcF1aea52CE27A302E521aF9dBDD27D2E7`](https://explorer.benzo.space/address/0x25B6a6bcF1aea52CE27A302E521aF9dBDD27D2E7) |
| `BabyJubJub` library | [`0xbADeF08FE085928c36cF1301CfAa4d8061DA2469`](https://explorer.benzo.space/address/0xbADeF08FE085928c36cF1301CfAa4d8061DA2469) |
| tx-allowlist precompile | `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000002` |

**Live proof (reproducible on the public RPC):**

1. **Confidential transfer**, a private eERC transfer with the amount encrypted
   on-chain (Groth16), decrypt-verified against the sender/receiver balances, has
   been run on BenzoNet.
   - Reproduce: `PRIVATE_KEY=<deployer> PRIVATE_KEY_2=<ops> BENZONET_RPC_URL=https://rpc.benzo.space npx hardhat run scripts/deploy/benzonet-confidential-demo.ts --network benzonet`
2. **Gated access**, a funded but non-allow-listed wallet is rejected at the
   tx-allowlist precompile before its tx reaches a block (*"cannot issue
   transaction from non-allow listed address"*). Only an Admin/Manager
   (`benzo-ops`) can Enable a wallet, the gated-onboarding step.
   - Reproduce: `PRIVATE_KEY=<deployer> BENZONET_RPC_URL=https://rpc.benzo.space npx hardhat run scripts/deploy/benzonet-gated-access-demo.ts --network benzonet`

Together these are the two privacy primitives stacked on one chain: eERC hides the
*amounts*, the permissioned L1 walls off *who can transact*, encrypted value
moving inside a gated, auditor-ready chain.

## Mainnet Status, live

Benzo is **live on the Avalanche C-Chain mainnet (`43114`)**. The full eERC
converter stack (10 contracts) is deployed and wrapping **real Circle USDC**
(`tokenId 1`) and EURC (`tokenId 2`), the production Groth16 phase-2 ceremony is
complete, the auditor key is set on-chain, and the CCTP onramp has been proven
end-to-end with a real cross-chain burn. Addresses are in the
[mainnet table above](#deployed-on-avalanche-mainnet--live); the full go/no-go
record is in [`docs/MAINNET_GO_NO_GO.md`](docs/MAINNET_GO_NO_GO.md).

Mainnet is **C-Chain converter only**, BenzoNet stays testnet-only and no mainnet
BenzoNet is deployed. This is a fresh deployment and is **not** yet
production-hardened; see "What remains" below.

**How it got here: config vs. new work.**

| Category | What it covered | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pure config** | RPC `https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc`, explorer `snowtrace.io`, chainId `43114`; CCTP domain unchanged (Avalanche = `1`); attestation base sandbox → prod (`iris-api.circle.com`); separate prod secrets (`APP_MASTER_KEY`, `OPS_PRIVATE_KEY`, deployer, auditor, `DATABASE_URL`). | Cut over at deploy |
| **New code (shipped + exercised on testnet)** | Token-agnostic per-network deploy, the `avalanche` network wiring, and the guard-railed `deploy:mainnet` command. | Deployed to mainnet |
| **New crypto (the hard part)** | A multi-machine Groth16 phase-2 ceremony to replace the dev (`contributions:0`) verifiers. | **Done, 3-machine contribution chain + public drand beacon (round 30261477); verifiers regenerated, marker flipped to `build:"ceremony"`, browser proving keys re-coupled. Transcript: [`docs/ceremony/transcript.md`](docs/ceremony/transcript.md)** |

**Circle / CCTP V2 mainnet addresses (external Circle contracts).**

| Thing | Address (Avalanche C-Chain `43114`) |
| --- | --- |
| USDC | `0xB97EF9Ef8734C71904D8002F8b6Bc66Dd9c48a6E` |
| EURC | `0xC891EB4cbdEFf6e073e859e987815Ed1505c2ACD` |
| CCTP `TokenMessengerV2` | `0x28b5a0e9C621a5BadaA536219b3a228C8168cf5d` |
| CCTP `MessageTransmitterV2` | `0x81D40F21F12A8F0E3252Bccb954D722d4c464B64` |

The mainnet converter wraps **real Circle USDC** (never a `TestUSDC`), pinned to
`tokenId 1`. The deploy ran through `pnpm --filter @benzo/contracts deploy:mainnet`,
which sends no transaction unless every guardrail passes (confirm flag, chainId
`43114`, existing-USDC wrapping, a **ceremony** verifier build, distinct
deployer/auditor keys, a funded deployer, and an operator-provided auditor key).

**What remains (honest post-deploy work).**

- **Admin is still the hot deploy key.** The `Ownable` admin across the mainnet
  contracts is the deployer (`0x09b6…9846`); it has **not** been transferred to a
  multisig or cold wallet. That transfer is the top post-deploy item.
- **Onramp is single-test-proven.** The CCTP onramp is proven by **one** 0.1 USDC
  Base→Avalanche burn (settle tx `0xc479b7c8…f8a3`). It is not load-tested,
  fuzzed, or adversarially hardened, and it is not audited.
- **Source-verified on Snowtrace.** Per the deployment manifest, all ten mainnet
  contracts are source-verified on Snowtrace (see the Verified column in the
  mainnet table).
- **Ceremony trust model.** The phase-2 ceremony was a single-coordinator, 3-machine
  run, not an open multi-party ceremony. Its soundness rests on the published,
  re-verifiable transcript plus the unbiasable drand beacon, not on a large set of
  independent external participants.
- **W3 is reveal-and-verify, not a ZK disclosure circuit.** Selective disclosure /
  proof-of-payment reveals the underlying values and verifies them; it is **not** a
  zero-knowledge disclosure proof. That limitation is intentional and stated
  plainly rather than dressed up.

## Repository Layout

## Five-Minute Quickstart

Prerequisites: Node.js 22+, pnpm, and Docker for the API test suite.

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm compile && pnpm --filter @benzo/contracts zkit:make && pnpm test
```

That installs the workspace, compiles the contracts, generates ignored local
zkit artifacts for the proof-heavy contract tests, and runs the test suites.
After `contracts/zkit/` exists locally, the shorter loop is:

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm compile && pnpm test
```

No Fuji private key is needed for the quickstart. Deployment and smoke commands
that touch Fuji or BenzoNet require operator-held keys and are documented in
[`contracts/README.md`](contracts/README.md) and
[`infra/README.md`](infra/README.md).

## Testing

Three tiers, all config-driven off `@benzo/config` so mainnet is a manifest swap:

- **Unit / default**, `pnpm test`. Fundless, no network; the Fuji-fork and funded
  tiers self-skip here so this stays fast and green.
- **TIER 1, Fuji-fork integration** (`.github/workflows/fuji-fork.yml`, runs on
  every PR + push). `FORK=fuji pnpm --filter @benzo/contracts test` forks Fuji at
  a pinned block and exercises `BenzoCCTPRouter` against **real** Circle USDC +
  the real CCTP `TokenMessenger` bytecode (happy path, fee-shortfall, duplicate
  message, unregistered recipient). Fundless, no secrets, no keys.
- **TIER 2, funded live-testnet e2e** (`tests/e2e`, `@benzo/e2e`;
  `.github/workflows/e2e-live.yml`, nightly + manual, **not** a required check).
  Real testnet funds. Every suite self-skips unless `RUN_LIVE_E2E=1` and its
  funded accounts (`BENZO_ONRAMP_USER_KEY` / `BENZO_RELAYER_KEY` / …) are present
  and funded, a missing/underfunded account turns into a precise `Fund 0x… on
  fuji …` skip, never a failure. Suites: `eerc-core`, `cctp-onramp`, `disclosure`,
  `payroll-batch`, `auditor-rotate`, `benzonet-gating`. A concurrency group
  serializes runs so they never race the relayer nonce. Run locally with
  `RUN_LIVE_E2E=1 pnpm --filter @benzo/e2e test`.

No address is ever hard-coded in a test body, everything resolves from the
`@benzo/config` deployment manifest, so pointing a tier at mainnet is a config
change, not a code change. See `.env.example` for the testnet-only variables.
