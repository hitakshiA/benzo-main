# @benzo/api

Fastify service for Benzo off-chain workflows. It owns HTTP, Postgres,
Drizzle migrations, pg-boss jobs, SIWE sessions, and health checks.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @benzo/api dev
pnpm --filter @benzo/api db:migrate
pnpm --filter @benzo/api index:backfill --from-block 12345
pnpm --filter @benzo/api test
pnpm --filter @benzo/api build
```

`GET /healthz` checks Postgres with `select 1` and reads the current block
number from `BENZONET_RPC_URL`.

## Environment

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | Postgres connection string used by Drizzle and pg-boss. |
| `BENZONET_RPC_URL` | No | Avalanche Fuji, local anvil, or BenzoNet JSON-RPC URL used for health, SIWE signature verification fallbacks, and the eERC indexer. Defaults to the live Fuji RPC. |
| `OPS_PRIVATE_KEY` | Yes | `0x`-prefixed operator key used for network-admin writes: auditor rotation, BenzoNet allowlist updates, and admin gas drips. It is validated at boot but never logged. |
| `APP_MASTER_KEY` | Yes | 32-byte hex key reserved for libsodium secretbox encrypted-at-rest fields. It may include `0x`; the service normalizes it internally. |
| `PAYROLL_ZK_ARTIFACT_DIR` | No | Directory containing `registration.wasm`, `registration.zkey`, `transfer.wasm`, and `transfer.zkey` for server-side treasury registration and payroll proving. Defaults to `services/api/zk-artifacts`. |
| `PAYROLL_TOKEN_ID` | No | Legacy USDC payroll token id fallback used only when the deployment manifest has no USDC token entry. Multi-token payroll resolves token ids from the manifest tokens map. Defaults to `1`. |
| `PAYROLL_EERC_DECIMALS` | No | Decimal precision used when scaling CSV amounts to eERC transfer values. Defaults to `6`. |
| `BENZONET_CHAIN_ID` | No | SIWE chain id. Defaults to Fuji `43113`; set to BenzoNet `68420` when `CHAIN_ENV=benzonet`. |
| `CHAIN_ENV` | No | `fuji` or `benzonet`. Defaults to `fuji` when `BENZONET_CHAIN_ID=43113`, otherwise `benzonet`. Config load rejects mismatched chain ids. Fuji records tx allowlist as a no-op and drips gas with a plain AVAX transfer. |
| `KYC_PROVIDER` | No | Currently only `mock`. The mock provider records name/country only and never accepts documents. |
| `DRIP_WEI` | No | Native gas amount to send/mint during onboarding. Defaults to `500000000000000000` (0.5 native). |
| `DRIP_BALANCE_THRESHOLD_WEI` | No | Skip gas drip when the user balance is already at least this amount. Defaults to `500000000000000000`. |
| `EERC_REGISTRAR_ADDRESS` | No | Registrar contract address, used both for onboarding registration polling and by the indexer. Defaults to Fuji `0x9a63FEa9851097DBAf3757b636217fdde50ABaF0`. |
| `EERC_DEPLOYMENT_MANIFEST` | No | Deployment manifest path. A fallback source for the Registrar address, only consulted if `EERC_REGISTRAR_ADDRESS` resolves empty (it always has a default under the current schema, so this is effectively inert). Defaults to `contracts/deployments/{CHAIN_ENV}.json`. |
| `ONBOARDING_REGISTRATION_POLL_SECONDS` | No | Registration polling interval. Defaults to `15`. |
| `EERC_ENCRYPTED_ERC_ADDRESS` | No | EncryptedERC contract address to index. Resolves from the `@benzo/config` deployment manifest for the active `CHAIN_ENV` (Fuji `0x9E16eD3B799541B4929f7E2014904C65E81035b1`). |
| `INDEXER_CONFIRMATIONS` | No | Confirmation depth before logs are indexed. Defaults to `6`. |
| `INDEXER_ENABLED` | No | Set to `false` to disable the pg-boss scheduled poller. Defaults to `true`. |
| `INDEXER_MAX_WINDOW_BLOCKS` | No | Maximum log scan window. Defaults to `2000`. |
| `INDEXER_POLL_CRON` | No | pg-boss cron expression for polling. Defaults to every 5 seconds, `*/5 * * * * *`. |
| `INDEXER_START_BLOCK` | No | Initial block when no cursor exists. Defaults to `0`; set this to the deployment block in production. |
| `PORT` | No | HTTP port. Defaults to `3000`. |
| `HOST` | No | Listen host. Defaults to `0.0.0.0`. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | Pino log level. Defaults to `info`. |
| `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME` | No | httpOnly session cookie name. Defaults to `benzo_session`. |
| `SESSION_TTL_DAYS` | No | Session lifetime. Defaults to `7`. |
| `SIWE_NONCE_TTL_MINUTES` | No | Nonce lifetime. Defaults to `10`. |

## Data Classification

| Data | Classification | Storage |
|---|---|---|
| Wallet address | Plaintext | Stored in `users.address` and `siwe_nonces.address` so sessions and roles can bind to an EVM account. |
| User roles | Plaintext | Stored in `users.roles`; these are operational authorization labels only. |
| Session id | Plaintext secret | Stored in `sessions.id` and sent only as an httpOnly SameSite=Lax cookie. |
| SIWE nonce | Plaintext secret | Stored in `siwe_nonces.nonce` until it is consumed or expires. |
| Mock KYC payload | Plaintext MOCK workflow data | Stored in `kyc_records.payload` as name/country only with `MOCK_KYC_NO_DOCUMENTS`. Do not store documents or real-provider payloads here. |
| Onboarding state | Plaintext workflow state | Stored in `onboardings` and `drips`, including status, tx hashes, and operational errors. This is workflow tracking, not payment privacy. |
| Audit metadata | Plaintext by default | Stored in `audit_log.meta`; do not put private payment details here. Future fields that need at-rest privacy should use `APP_MASTER_KEY` and libsodium secretbox before insertion. |
| Handles | Plaintext public routing data | Stored in `handles.handle` and mirrored from HandleRegistry. Contract state is authoritative; the table is a read cache. |
| Contacts | Plaintext user workflow data | Stored in `contacts` per owner wallet. Contact addresses and aliases are not payment privacy data. |
| Invite tokens | Hashed secret | Only `sha256(raw_token)` is stored in `invites.token_hash`; raw claim URLs are returned once on creation and cannot be reconstructed from the DB. |
| Gift metadata | Workflow metadata | Stored in `invites.kind`, `gift_amount`, and `note`; the API does not custody funds, keys, ciphertexts, or proofs. |
| eERC decryption keys | Never server-side (consumer) | Consumer keys stay wallet-derived/client-side and never leave the device; the API neither accepts nor persists them. The exceptions are org-treasury activity where an org opts into a managed key, and auditor compliance views, separate authorization boundaries that must never be used for consumer activity. |
| eERC event routing metadata | Plaintext | Stored in `events.tx_hash`, `events.log_index`, `events.block_number`, `events.block_hash`, `events.block_time`, `events.contract`, `events.event_name`, `events.from_addr`, and `events.to_addr` so participants can fetch activity without browser chain rescans. |
| eERC raw log bytes | Opaque chain bytes | Stored in `events.raw_log` as `address`, `topics`, and ABI `data` hex for replay/debugging. The API does not materialize decoded consumer amount fields from these bytes into columns or response fields. |
| eERC ciphertext/PCT blobs | Opaque bytes | Stored in `events.ciphertext` and `events.amount_pct`; returned as hex strings. The API does not decrypt, interpret, or convert these blobs to amounts. |
| Proving artifacts or secrets | Never server-side | Generated proving artifacts and secrets must not be committed or stored by the API. |
| Org treasury keys | Sealed at rest (opt-in, org-scoped) | The managed treasury EOA key (and, once registered, its eERC key) are stored **only** as `org_treasuries.sealed_eoa_key` / `sealed_eerc_key`, sealed under `APP_MASTER_KEY` with AES-256-GCM. They are never returned in a response, never logged, and unsealed only in the payroll worker. Custody requires explicit recorded consent. These sealed keys are spendable funds, see the disaster-recovery issue. |
| Auditor BabyJubJub keys | Sealed at rest (auditor-scoped) | Auditor private keys are stored **only** as `auditor_keys.sealed_key`, sealed under `APP_MASTER_KEY` with AES-256-GCM. The API unseals the active historical key in memory only for `/auditor/*` requests, returns plaintext amounts only in that response, and writes one `audit_log` row for each decrypted event. |

## Organizations & Managed Treasury

Businesses run payroll from an **org**. Membership is role-ranked
(`owner` > `admin` > `operator` > `viewer`); org routes gate on a minimum role
and return `404` (not `403`) to non-members so org existence isn't leaked.

| Route | Min role | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /orgs` | authenticated | Create an org; the creator becomes `owner`. |
| `GET /orgs` | authenticated | Orgs the caller belongs to, with their role. |
| `GET /orgs/:id` · `GET /orgs/:id/members` | `viewer` | Org detail / member list. |
| `POST /orgs/:id/members` | `admin` | Add/update a member by wallet address (must be a known SIWE user). |
| `GET /orgs/:id/members/:address/allowlist` | `viewer` | Member KYC status plus current tx-allowlist role. |
| `POST /orgs/:id/members/:address/allowlist` | `admin` | Enable a KYC-approved member on the BenzoNet tx-allowlist. |
| `DELETE /orgs/:id/members/:address/allowlist` | `admin` | Revoke a member from the BenzoNet tx-allowlist. |
| `POST /orgs/:id/treasury` | `admin` | Provision the managed treasury (see below). |
| `GET /orgs/:id/treasury` | `viewer` | Custody status only, never key material. |

Org member allowlisting requires an approved KYC record before the API calls the
tx-allowlist precompile. Each enable/revoke writes `org_member_allowlist` and
`audit_log`. On Fuji the chain result is the documented
`noop_fuji_no_tx_allowlist`; the real transaction gate exists only when
`CHAIN_ENV=benzonet`.

**Managed treasury custody.** eERC transfer proofs need the *sender's* key, so a
payroll run can't prove client-side without pinning a browser tab. Each org may
opt into a server-held treasury: `POST /orgs/:id/treasury` generates an EOA,
seals its private key under `APP_MASTER_KEY` (AES-256-GCM, equivalent AEAD
guarantee to libsodium secretbox, no native dependency), records the custody
consent moment (`consent: true` is required), runs treasury allowlist/gas
onboarding, registers the treasury with the eERC Registrar, and seals the
managed BabyJubJub key in `sealed_eerc_key`. The sealed keys are unsealed only
inside payroll registration/worker code; they are never returned or logged.

Server-side Groth16 proving needs local generated artifacts. Build them from
the contracts workspace, then copy only the runtime files into the ignored API
artifact directory:

```bash
HOME=/tmp/benzo-zkit-45 pnpm --filter @benzo/contracts zkit:make
mkdir -p services/api/zk-artifacts
cp contracts/zkit/artifacts/circuits/registration.circom/RegistrationCircuit_js/RegistrationCircuit.wasm services/api/zk-artifacts/registration.wasm
cp contracts/zkit/artifacts/circuits/registration.circom/RegistrationCircuit.groth16.zkey services/api/zk-artifacts/registration.zkey
cp contracts/zkit/artifacts/circuits/transfer.circom/TransferCircuit_js/TransferCircuit.wasm services/api/zk-artifacts/transfer.wasm
cp contracts/zkit/artifacts/circuits/transfer.circom/TransferCircuit.groth16.zkey services/api/zk-artifacts/transfer.zkey
```

Do not commit `services/api/zk-artifacts/`; `.wasm` and `.zkey` files are
generated proving artifacts.

## Activity Indexer

The pg-boss poller schedules `eerc.indexer.poll` every 5 seconds by default. It
indexes confirmed logs from `EncryptedERC` and `Registrar` in windows of at most
`INDEXER_MAX_WINDOW_BLOCKS`, upserts by `(tx_hash, log_index)`, and advances
`chain_cursor.last_block` only after each batch commits. `chain_cursor` also
stores the last block hash so a parent-hash mismatch can rewind and rescan the
previous window.

Indexed event names are `PrivateTransfer`, `Deposit`, `Withdraw`,
`PrivateMint`, `PrivateBurn`, `Register`, and `AuditorChanged`.

Routes:

- `GET /activity?address=&cursor=&limit=` returns activity for the authenticated
  wallet only. `cursor` is the returned `blockNumber:logIndex` value.
- `GET /receipts/:txHash` returns receipt events and `event_links` labels only
  when the authenticated wallet is a participant.
- `GET /activity/stream` is a participant-scoped SSE stream for live activity.
- `GET /admin/indexer` returns lag, cursors, and event counts for
  `network_admin` users.

## Auditor Compliance

The compliance API is server-side and authoritative: `/auditor/events` and
`/auditor/report/:address` select indexed eERC events, choose the auditor key
that was active at each event block, decrypt the event PCT in memory, and return
plaintext amounts only in the HTTP response. Plaintext amounts are never written
back to Postgres.

Routes:

- `GET /auditor/events?address=&from=&to=&limit=&offset=` requires `auditor`.
  `address` filters to events where the address is sender or recipient.
- `GET /auditor/report/:address?from=&to=` requires `auditor` and returns
  aggregate inflow/outflow totals for the address.
- `POST /admin/auditor/rotate` requires `network_admin`, generates or accepts a
  handoff auditor BabyJubJub private key, calls the chain rotation boundary,
  waits for the confirmed receipt, retires the old DB row, and inserts the
  sealed new row in one transaction. For the current vendored EncryptedERC
  contract, pass the registered `auditorAddress` from the M2 handoff with the
  matching BabyJubJub `privateKey`.
- `POST /admin/roles` grants or revokes `auditor` and `network_admin` roles.
  Role changes are audit-logged.
- `GET /admin/audit-log` returns recent audit entries for review.

Rotation runbook:

1. Rotate when auditor personnel or custody policy changes, after suspected key
   exposure, or during scheduled compliance drills.
2. Confirm `OPS_PRIVATE_KEY` is the EncryptedERC owner/operator for the target
   network and has native gas. The key must be supplied through the deployment
   secret manager, not committed.
3. Call `POST /admin/auditor/rotate`. If importing the M2 Fuji auditor handoff,
   pass the registered auditor EVM address and BabyJubJub private key in the
   request body once; the response never returns that private key, and the DB
   stores only the sealed blob.
4. Wait for the indexer to ingest the matching `AuditorChanged` event. The DB
   row stores the rotation tx hash and activation block so old events continue
   to decrypt under the retired key and new events decrypt under the active key.

Old keys are retained by design. A pre-rotation event's PCT can only decrypt
with the key active when the event was emitted; deleting retired rows makes that
history permanently opaque. Disaster case: if an `auditor_keys.sealed_key` blob
or `APP_MASTER_KEY` is lost, affected historical events cannot be recovered.
That is the intended privacy failure mode, not a data-repair task.

## Network Admin

Network-admin routes require `network_admin`:

- `POST /admin/allowlist` with `{ "address": "0x...", "action": "enable" |
  "revoke" }` pre-checks the BenzoNet allowlist precompile and then calls
  `setEnabled` or `setNone`.
- `GET /admin/allowlist/:address` reads current allowlist status.
- `POST /admin/drip` sends or mints native gas without the onboarding 24-hour
  limit and records both `drips` and `audit_log` rows.
- `GET /admin/chain` returns latest block, wall-clock block lag, operator and
  treasury balances, and indexer lag.

`event_links` correlates tx hashes to product objects such as onboardings,
invites, and later payroll items so receipts can show labels like
`Payroll June` without changing indexed event privacy.

The backfill command uses the same scanner path as the poller:

```bash
pnpm --filter @benzo/api index:backfill --from-block <n>
```

## Auth Flow

1. `GET /auth/nonce?address=0x...` creates a short-lived nonce bound to the wallet address.
2. The client signs an EIP-4361 SIWE message for `BENZONET_CHAIN_ID`.
3. `POST /auth/verify` verifies the nonce, chain id, domain, and signature, then sets the session cookie.
4. `GET /auth/me` returns the authenticated wallet and roles.
5. `POST /auth/logout` deletes the server session and clears the cookie.

The role decorators are `requireAuth` and `requireRole("network_admin" |
"auditor")`.

## Onboarding API

- `POST /onboarding/start` starts or resumes the authenticated user's workflow and enqueues `onboarding.advance` with a per-address singleton key.
- `GET /onboarding/status` returns the authenticated user's current workflow state and tx hashes.
- `GET /onboarding/status/stream` streams status updates as SSE and closes once the workflow reaches `complete` or `failed`.
- `GET /admin/onboardings?status=` lists recent onboarding rows for `network_admin` operators.

## Identity Routes

- `POST /handles` claims a lowercase `@handle` through the injected
  HandleRegistry client and mirrors the result to Postgres.
- `GET /resolve/:handle` returns public routing data with `Cache-Control:
  public, max-age=60`, an `ETag`, and a `source` field (`chain` or `cache`).
- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /contacts` manages the authenticated user's contact
  book and enriches list responses with cached handles plus eERC registration
  status from the chain client.
- `POST /invites` creates invite or gift-link metadata and returns the raw token
  exactly once. `GET /invites/:token` exposes kind, note, creator handle, and
  status, never gift amount. `POST /invites/:token/claim` marks the invite
  claimed and triggers the onboarding orchestrator interface for the claimant.
